============

The assignment:

Implement a dynamically generated input form using React [http://facebook.github.io/react/](http://facebook.github.io/react/). Generate a form based on some JSON that looks like the following [JSON data](http://facebook.github.io/react/). Feel free to extend the JSON with ideas of your own. The idea here is that the form for editing an object is generated at runtime based only on that object.

## To use

```
npm install
gulp
node server.js
```

And visit http://localhost:3000/.


Of course, I didn't need to use node or gulp or browserify, but I wanted to better simulate what kind of components a production level app might use.
